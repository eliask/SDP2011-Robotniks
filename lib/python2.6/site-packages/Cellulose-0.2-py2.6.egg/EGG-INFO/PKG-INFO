        Cellulose 0.2 has a few backwards-incompatible changes.  Check the README for
        more information.
        
        Changelog from 0.1.2 to 0.2::
        
          * All tests pass with Python 2.5.
          * ComputedCell is now thread safe.
          * ComputedDict is now a little more friendly for subclassing.
          * The 'restrictions' functionality has been moved into it's own set of classes.
          * InputCellDescriptor will now take a default value.
          * Cell descriptors in general are easier to subclass.
          * DependantCell.dependency_changed now takes the dependency as an argument.
        
        Sales Pitch (only I'm no salesman)
        ==================================
        
        Cellulose provides a mechanism for maintaining consistency between
        inter-dependant values with caching and lazy evaluation.
        
        You can think of it like a spreadsheet program --  Many cells are are calculated
        from the values of other cells.  When one cell changes, all of the dependant
        cells get updated with new values.
        
        However, cellulose goes quite a ways beyond this.  It guarantees that when a
        value is read, it is consistant with all the values it depends on.  It also is
        lazy (read: efficient.)  Calculating a value is put off till the very last
        possible moment, and only recalculated when absolutely needed.
        
        Dependency discovery and cache invalidation are fully transparent and automatic.
        This greatly reduces a major source of bugs in software.
        
        A goal of the project is to be as simple as possible, (but no simpler,) so that
        anyone wanting to seriously use it could easily understand the internals.
        
        Cellulose is similar in purpose to PyCells, but is in a way 'lower level'.  It
        tries real hard to stay out of your way, but, as a result, lacks some of the
        helpers that PyCells provides.  The most essential algorithmic difference is
        probably that Cellulose desperately wants to be lazy, while in PyCells everything
        is calculated immediately (by default.)  (On the flipside of this, observers in
        PyCells are quite a bit easier to work with.)
